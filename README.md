## Useful git commands (run these while inside the repository)

### Set your username and email.

To set it globally just add the `--global` flag right after `git config`.

```
$ git config user.name "<insert your name>"

$ git config user.email "<insert email>"
```

### Have git save your credentials in `~/.git-credentials`, so you don't have to enter your name and password all the time.

#### WARNING!!! This will store the password in plain text.

```
$ git config credential.helper store
```
