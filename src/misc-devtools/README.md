This folder is for things that are not necessary for the program, but were made to help create something else.

# Scripts.

`pyfiglet-fonttest.py` is a script that prints out all the available pyfiglet fonts in a menu, and the user can few what each font looks like.

It was used in creating the intro text shown when starting the game.

FYI: PyFiglet is a python port of the program figlet which is a program that takes text and prints them out in larger letters.
